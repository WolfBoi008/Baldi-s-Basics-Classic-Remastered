May be changed in the future.\n- Defeat NULL: Defeat NULL in the game's final challenge.\nWARNING: Is not recommended unless you're really good at the game. This challenge is HARD for a newcomer.\nAs a guide, unlocking the fight against NULL requires you to:\n1. Beat all 3 Styles\n2. Beat a Style with all 3 Challenges Activated\n3. and get the Alternate Ending in each of the 3 Styles.\nDoing all of this will allow you to fight NULL by clicking on Baldi in the Style selection screen. Good luck.",
